            <p>A monolith in the night sky.</p>

            <p><strong class="emp">Nightrök</strong> is more than just a name — it’s a story.
            It began years ago as <strong>Nightrock</strong>, the identity of a lone web developer crafting digital experiences in solitude. That chapter has closed. Now, from its foundation rises something new.</p>

            <p>Inspired by <strong>Ragnarök</strong> in Norse mythology — not just the end, but the promise of renewal and rebirth — <strong class="emp">Nightrök</strong> represents a turning point. The dusk of one path, and the dawn of another.</p>

            <p>Today, <strong class="emp">Nightrök</strong> is dedicated to creating games. Worlds to explore, systems to master, stories to discover. This is not simply a project, but a commitment: to follow passion, to learn through making, and to shape ideas into experiences worth sharing.</p>

            <p><strong class="emp">Nightrök</strong> is the journey of starting again.
            The end of what was. The beginning of what can be.</p>
